# TreeFinityGarden - Grow your own garden with fractal trees

## A fully functional game written in Python with Tkinter

- Grow your own trees
- A wide variety of colorings and shapes of fractals
- Diverse achievements
- Tamagotchi-inspired design

## Run app

At the moment we have two applications in one.<br/>
The first one starts the game itself (you need to run the file main.py).<br/>
The second one is made for developers so that they can create different trees and save them for future use (you need to start a file tree_generator.py)
